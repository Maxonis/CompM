In this experiment I will focus on unearthing seasonal trends in musical listenership. Using as large a slice as possible of the most popular song on Spotify on any given day of the year (if possible over the past several years to further increase the data I have to work with), I will attempt to quantify trends in genre, artist, song length, and any other statistic I where such a trend could be reasonably extrapolated.
